      <description>Introduction This post is a follow-on from my first post on this topic. Dr. Cameron Murray and Leith van Onselen. further.
Really only a couple of charts are required to substantiated the mobility thesis outlined earlier in the previous post. The following one shows clearly how Australia has become a place to arrive long-term, and leave from short-term, which is the core contention of my thesis.</description>

      <description>This post is a follow-on from my first post on this topic. In that post I pointed to a couple of alternative statistics which can be derived from ABS data, including “Net Overseas Movements”, and “Physically Present Population”. I suggested Australia’s migration rate might be substantially overstated by “Net Overseas Migration” (NOM), and the derived “Estimated Resident Population” (ERP) might also look bit frothy, or even a million people frothy according to ABS data.</description>

      <description>It’s time that someone took a proper tilt at Australia’s high migration rate. No, I don’t mean like Dick Smith, splashing millions on an advertising campaign arguing that such a high rate is unsustainable and that we should return down to previous levels. I mean taking a few hours with the data source to figure out whether Australia’s migration rate actually is any higher than it was at previous levels.</description>

      <description>I think it’s worth a short post to explain where the name ‘Quixotic Quant’ came from.
Quixotic This word sums up my intent to use this blog to ‘tilt at windmills’, in the metaphorical style of Don Quixote. By ‘tilt’ I mean it as it’s meant in jousting. Take a direct charge against an idea and try to topple it, or at least have an exciting clash of intellectual arms, and hopefully have some fun and amuse onlookers while you’re at it.</description>
