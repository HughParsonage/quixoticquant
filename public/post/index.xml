      <description>Imagine that one of the most important graphs for economic and policy planning was wrong. I mean seriously wrong. Wrong enough that any first-year stats student would fail their assignments if they presented it. Imagine that correcting its misuse might require statistically annihilating about a million people from Australia’s population. That’s the equivalent of the combined populations of Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and the ACT.</description>

      <description>I think it’s worth a short post to explain where the name ‘Quixotic Quant’ came from, and why I’ve chosen it for this blog. The short version is that it’s a neat way of capturing a simple juxtaposition this blog seeks to embrace: 1. A high standard of rigour, objectivity, transparency to the quantitative analysis 2. A style that’s intellectually combative, provocative, and accessible and entertaining to a broad audience Regarding the first objective, I’m convinced that the best standard for objectivity and rigour is to publish not only a link to the data at source, but also the code-chunk that’s been used to conduct the analysis.</description>
