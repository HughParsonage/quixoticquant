      <description>Imagine that one of the most important graphs for economic and policy planning was wrong. I mean seriously wrong. Wrong enough that any first-year stats student would fail their assignments if they presented it, and that correcting its misuse might require statistically annihilating about a million people from Australia’s population. That’s the equivalent of the combined populations of Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and the ACT.</description>

      <description>hhh I think it’s worth a short post to explain where the name ‘Quixotic Quant’ came from, and why I’ve chosen it for this blog. The short version is that it’s a neat way of capturing a simple juxtaposition this blog seeks to embrace: 1. A high standard of rigour, objectivity, transparency to the quantitative analysis 2. A style that’s intellectually combative, provocative, and accessible and entertaining to a broad audience Regarding the first objective, I’m convinced that the best standard for objectivity and rigour is to publish not only a link to the data at source, but also the code-chunk that’s been used to conduct the analysis.</description>

      <description>Aidan took leave from a PhD in experimental particle physics at the University of Melbourne, working in the ATLAS experiment at CERN, to start Rubber Ducky Defence. Combining strong academic background in physics, along with a passion for lateral–thinking and global, real–world problem solving, Aidan’s initial intrigue with military strategy and technology was inspired whilst working with the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Economics and Government, where he met and began discussing the anomalies of defence policy with some of Australia’s leading defence experts.</description>
