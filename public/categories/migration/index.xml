      <description>It’s time that someone took a proper tilt at Australia’s high migration rate. No, I don’t mean like Dick Smith, splashing millions on an advertising campaign arguing that such a high rate is unsustainable and that we should return down to previous levels. I mean taking a few hours with the data source (the Australian Bureau of Statistics website) and an R session to figure out whether Australia’s migration rate actually is any higher than it was at previous levels.</description>
