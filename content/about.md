Aidan took leave from a PhD in experimental particle physics at the University of Melbourne, working in the ATLAS experiment at CERN, to start Rubber Ducky Defence. Combining strong academic background in physics, along with a passion for lateral–thinking and global, real–world problem solving, Aidan’s initial intrigue with military strategy and technology was inspired whilst working with the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Economics and Government, where he met and began discussing the anomalies of defence policy with some of Australia’s leading defence experts. Applying his skills in physical and statistical analysis to problems normally only discussed qualitatively by commentators and policy–makers, he’s been developing the analysis and inventions underlying Rubber Ducky’s innovation ever since.
