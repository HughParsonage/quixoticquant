I was born and raised in Launceston, Tasmania, and attended Launceston Church Grammar School before moving to Canberra to study at the Australian National University.  I completed a Bachelor of Science with First Class Honours.  My majors were in Physics and Theoretical Physics, and my thesis was in Theoretical Particle Physics, on Kaon Decay in the Generation Model.  I took up a PhD scholarship to the University of Melbourne were I worked in the experimental particle physics, including on the ATLAS experiment at CERN.

I left my PhD before completing it to start life as an entrepreneur, setting ambitious goals that were in some ways also akin to tilting at windmills.

My first venture, [Rubber Ducky Defence](www.rubberduckydefence.com.au), was inspired and informed by my experience calculating collision cross-sections of subatomic particles. Certain principals applied well at other scales, and I decided to tilt at the windmill that said that bigger ships were better at winning naval battles.  Rubber Ducky has advanced designs for a small boat and torpedo optimised for swarming attacks, including one grated patent in the US.

My second venture sought to challenge the notion that quirky bars with cool cocktails were the preserve of the inner-urban elite, and couldn't possible survive South of Surry Hills and North of Melbourne.  With a few friends I'd met while working hospitality shifts to support my efforts with Rubber Ducky, I opened [Bat Country](batcountry.com.au), a bar/cafe/restaurant in the South-Eastern Suburb of Randwick inspired by the life and works of Hunter S. Thompson.  

For a couple of years I worked in a private research institute where I was heavily engaged in research and modelling relating to topics on economics and public policy.  Recently I co-founded [Trendlock](trendlock.com.au) with Ross Ireland. This venture seeks to challenge the idea that big-data will be most useful to big companies and govenment agencies who have the means and money to collect and anlyse it.  We're bringing the best of open-souce programming (particularly R) to make the power of big-data technologies like data-mining, machine-learning, and a host of statistical and forecasting methods available to medium and smaller enterprises.

I'm married to a beautiful French woman called Constance who I met several years ago while setting up Bat Country, which we still frequent as a welcome alternative to the mega-pubs that dominate the Easter Suburbs.  I've come to love swimming since living near the beach, though still love to run, particularly when I can escape the city to get off the beaten track.  When I can escape for a few days, white-water kayaking of skiing are also high on my agenda.
