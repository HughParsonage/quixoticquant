I think it’s worth a short post to explain where the name ‘Quixotic Quant’ came from.  

## Quixotic
This word sums up my intent to use this blog to 'tilt at windmills', as inspired by Don Qixote.  By 'tilt' I mean it as it's meant in jousting.  Take a direct charge against your opponent and try to knock them off their horse, hopefully have some fun and amuse onlookers while you're at it. 

I’ve recently formed the opinion that the surest way of burying a great idea that’s well supported by the evidence is to try to depersonalise it, and make it sound so objective, reasonable, and comprehensive that it can’t be refuted. The more worrying corollary is that plenty of ideas which are stupid and not even slightly supported by good analysis have become ascendant only because colourful, opinionated people have been less bashful about articulating them succinctly. Good ideas won’t win any more by staying above the fray.  So I figure it's all the better to go headlong into an argument with a healthy measure of vigour, even if you're not sure it's beyond refute, or don't know quite where it leads.  It makes it easier to understand and heightens the spectable to the onlooker, and will probably do better at arousing some constructive criticism and conversation.  If you find yourself a target, please charge back in defence, rather than take offence.

I've also found that my favourite sorts of targets are in many ways the 'windmills' of the modern world.  That is, they’re large slow-moving fixtures in our public intellectual consciousness that seem so enduring, obvious, and innocuous that people have lost all willingness to challenge them. It’s these ideas, the faulty foundations and enduring obsolete, which I think are the hidden 'ferocious giants' of our day. They're both the most fun to poke some holes in, and potentially most dangerous for society to leave entirely unmolested.  Most genuine tragedies of human policy and planning occur because some simple assumption that was widely held to be safe and reliable wasn't challenged enough until it was too late. 

## Quant
I've had at least as tumultuous a career as any millenial should hope for.  I'm probably at least as well-qualified to be a barista or bartender as I am to claim the title of economist, statistician, physicist, manager, data-scientist, though lately I spend almost all my time working in the latter roles.  Quant seemed to capture the common theme of those latter experiences, and also sum-up the approach I would generally try to take many of the issues that I'd be discussing.  That's not to say that I don't value non-quantitative skills and ideas.  Being too 'data-driven' is possible, in fact qualitative skills and ideas are the essential compliment to quantitative research.  But mostly I find that what I want to contribute to debate has to do with something that can and should be quantified. 

Where things can be quantified and analysed as such, I'll make the R-code which I've used to generate the charts and numbers available for anyone else to inspect, interrogate, and build-upon, as well as the original data-source, or at least the path to it.  Links to Github will be provided in each post.  While I'm most interested in spending time discussing the interpretation of data and the policy implications of that interpretation, having the correct data is at least as important.  If you think there's a mistake in my work please find it, I'll be glad to hear from you and fix it.  Or if there's more or better data which you know of that I could use, please let me know.

I must also give my thanks to Ross Ireland from [Trendlock](trendlock.com.au) who's done a great deal to advance my R skills over the last year or two, and even more in the last month or so to help me build the machinery that sits behind this blog.
